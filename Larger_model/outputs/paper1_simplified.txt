Simplify this abstract:
"""The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature."""

The Transformer is a new network architecture that uses attention mechanisms instead of recurrence or convolutions. It performs well on two machine translation tasks and is more parallelizable and requires less time to train compared to existing models. The Transformer achieves a new state-of-the-art BLEU score on the English-to-French translation task after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a significant improvement over existing models.
